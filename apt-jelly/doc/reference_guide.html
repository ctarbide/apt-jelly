            <h3><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              This page was intended as a reference guide for developers who are familiar with a <a href="templating_choices.html">templating engine</a>,
              <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/index.html">APT</a>, and the
              <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/index.html">Mirror API</a> and who have grokked the
              <a href="getting_started.html">getting started guide</a> and who need to know more detail in order to do some real development.  It's expected
              that developers will need to periodically refer to this guide (and most especially to the <a href="directives.html">directive documentation</a> and
              the <a href="decorations.html">decorated mirror API documentation</a>) to know how to use APT-Jelly in their templates.
            </p>

            <p>
              The example template snippets of this reference are Freemarker snippets, although each example is equally applicable to Jelly.
            </p>

            <br/>
            <hr/>
            <h3><a name="execution" id="execution"></a>Execution Context</h3>

            <p>
              When the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/com/sun/mirror/apt/AnnotationProcessorFactory.html">ProcessorFactory</a>
              is asked for a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/com/sun/mirror/apt/AnnotationProcessor.html">Processor</a>, it first
              establishes an execution context.  Most APT-Jelly directives assume that they are being invoked within this execution context so they can reference
              the <font class="code">AnnotationProcessorEnvironment</font> as needed.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's important to note that the execution context will direct all output to <font class="code">System.out</font> unless it is redirected somewhere
              else like a flat file or java source file (see the <a href="#directives">directive documentation</a>). While it is perfectly acceptable to use any
              available native directives to redirect output to a file on the local filesystem, it is assumed that most redirection will happen to an
              apt-generated artifact using the <font class="code">javaSource</font> and/or <font class="code">file</font> directives. This way, the files will
              be created relative to the directory specified by the "-s" option given to APT.
            </p>

            <h3><a name="model" id="model"></a>Data Model</h3>

            <p>
              Before invoking any templates, a data model is initialized with the options of the <font class="code">AnnotationProcessorEnvironment</font> being
              assigned to the variable "aptOptions".  Developers can look up any options passed to APT by referencing this variable.  For example, to output
              the value of the "-AMyAPTOption" option, the following snippet can be used:
            </p>

            <center>
              <div class="samplecode">
                <pre>
${aptOptions["-AMyAPTOption"]}
                </pre>
              </div>
            </center>

            <p>
              The other important feature enabled by the data model is that any variable that is assigned a value that is an instance of
              <font class="code">com.sun.mirror.declaration.Declaration</font>, <font class="code">com.sun.mirror.type.TypeMirror</font>, and
              <font class="code">com.sun.mirror.declaration.AnnotationMirror</font> is decorated before being assigned to the variable.  See
              <a href="#mirror">Decorated Mirror API</a> for more details.
            </p>

            <h3><a name="directives" id="directives"></a>APT-Jelly Directives</h3>

            <p>
              APT-Jelly includes a set of directives that are used to process a set of java source files.  Most of the directives are used to loop through the
              declarations and and types of the java source files and assign each item in the loop to a variable in the data model.  Three notable
              exceptions to this are the <font class="code">file</font> directive, the <font class="code">javaSource</font> directive, and the
              <font class="code">annotationValue</font> directive.  The first two directives are used to redirect the output to a generated artifact.  The third
              is used to output an annotation if it exists, or none if it doesn't exist.
            </p>

            <p>
              This section is intended to give a brief overview of the way the directives are used.  For specific details on the use of each directive, refer to
              the <a href="directives.html">directive documentation</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              A good place to start is by generating an artifact with the <font class="code">file</font> directive or the <font class="code">javaSource</font> directive.
              As should be expected, the <font class="code">file</font> directive generates a file and the <font class="code">javaSource</font> directive generates a java
              source file.  The name of the artifact is specified by the "name" parameter.  For a java source artifact, the name should be the fully-qualified
              name of the java class file for which this is to be the source.  For the <font class="code">file</font> directive, the name should be the simple name
              of the file, but this directive also allows parameters for the character set and the package relative to which this file should be placed.  The body
              of each of these directives is redirected to their respective artifacts.
            </p>

            <p>
              The java source declarations can be traversed using the <i>declaration loop directive</i>s.  A <i>declaration loop directive</i> is a directive that iterates through
              a set of declarations, possibly refering to a "parent" declaration to obtain this set.  A parent declaration is a declaration within which a set of
              other declarations is specified.  For example, the parent declaration of a method declaration would be a type declaration (e.g. a class or an interface).
              A declaration loop directive provides a parameter for specifying the name of the data model variable to which should be assigned a reference to the current
              declaration in the loop, and a parameter for specifying the name of the data model variable to which should be assigned the current loop index. The
              set of declarations over which a declaration loop directive iterates can also be filtered by the class name of an annotation using the "annotation" parameter.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will probably want to start by iterating over the set of all type declarations in your source base with the <font class="code">forAllTypes</font>
              directive, although another good place to start would be with the <font class="code">forAllPackages</font> directive if you want that level of granularity.
              Refering to the APT Mirror API documentation for <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/com/sun/mirror/declaration/TypeDeclaration.html">TypeDeclaration</a>,
              you will see that the set of type declarations is the set of all classes and interfaces (including enums and annotation types).  Note also that
              the documentation for the <font class="code">forAllTypes</font> directive states that interfaces aren't included by default.  If you want to include
              interfaces, you'll want to specify that with the "includeInterfaces" parameter.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once within a <font class="code">forAllTypes</font> directive, you can use other loop directives to iterate through each of the member declarations of the
              current type.  You'll want to do this through the use of the <font class="code">forAllConstructors</font>, <font class="code">forAllFields</font>,
              <font class="code">forAllMethods</font>, and <font class="code">forAllNestedTypes</font> directives.  You'll note in the documentation for these directives
              that it is possible to specify the parent declaration, but this is only necessary if these directives aren't nested within a declaration loop directive for
              a set of type declarations.
            </p>

            <p>
              When traversing a source base, eventually you will encounter a reference to a type (i.e. <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/com/sun/mirror/type/TypeMirror.html">TypeMirror</a>)
              that may or may not be declared.  You will want to be aware of the difference between a type declaration and a reference to a type in your
              template because they are modeled quite differently in the mirror API (and rightly so).  While some types may have declarations (e.g. a java class),
              others may not have declarations (e.g. arrays, primitive types, and the <font class="code">void</font> type).  Whether a type has a declaration is
              important to know because certain operations are only valid on the declarations of those types.  For example, you cannot determine whether a type
              reference is annotated with a specified annotation; only type declarations can be annotated.  To determine whether a type has a declaration, use
              the <font class="code">ifHasDeclaration</font> directive.
            </p>

            <p>
              A good example of this is when looking at a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/com/sun/mirror/declaration/MethodDeclaration.html">method declaration</a>.
              There are APT-Jelly directives that traverse through the constructs of a method declaration.  These are <font class="code">forAllParameters</font>, and
              <font class="code">forAllThrownTypes</font>.  There is also a parameter on the <font class="code">forAllMethods</font> directive that allows you to specify
              the name of a data model variable to which to assign the return type of the method.  As an illustration of the difference between a reference to a type
              and a type declaration, the parameters can be annotated (and thus filtered by a given annotation), but the thrown types of a method cannot.  To
              determine whether a given thrown type is annotated with a specified annotation, a reference to the declaration of the thrown type must be obtained.
              The recommended way to do this is with the <font class="code">ifHasDeclaration</font> directive.
            </p>

            <h3><a name="mirror" id="mirror"></a>Decorated Mirror API</h3>

            <p>
              When writing a template, you're eventually going to want to do more than just iterate through the declarations of your Java source base.  You
              may want to output the name of a declaration, or perhaps the value of an annotation element.  This is done through reference to the
              properties of a data model variable.  Therefore, a knowledge of the model for the objects in the data model is imperative when writing your
              template.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/index.html">Mirror API</a> is the object model that is provided by APT.  Each of
              the declarations and type mirrors in the Mirror API provides a set of relevant properties that can be accessed in the template.  However, because
              the Mirror API has been found to be inadequate or inconvenient to access in the data model, APT-Jelly decorates the Mirror API with other property
              accessors that make templating more easy.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, the Mirror API provides a property on <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/com/sun/mirror/declaration/AnnotationMirror.html">AnnotationMirror</a>
              that is a map of the element (method) declarations to the values of those elements on the annotation.  While this API is accurate and concise, it
              becomes difficult to reference the annotation value from the template.  APT-Jelly decorates <font class="code">AnnotationMirror</font> by adding properties
              for each of the elements of the annotation so they can be referenced from the template.  To illustrate, consider the following two template snippets.  Each
              snippet outputs the value of the "bar" element of the annotation "com.foo.Foo".  The first snippet uses the Mirror API as if it were not decorated.
              The second leverages the API as decorated by APT-Jelly.
            </p>

            <h3><a name="extending" id="extending"></a>Extending APT-Jelly</h3>

            <p>
              If APT-Jelly is missing a feature that you need, consider submitting a patch or making a request on the development mailing list.  However, in some cases,
              it may be more convenient for developers to extend APT-Jelly with their own directives.  For example, you may find it necessary to extend the
              <font class="code">forAllMethods</font> directive to iterate through your own special set of methods that meet certain specific requirements.  Fortunately,
              APT-Jelly boasts a clean, modular, and flexible API and can be very easily extended.
            </p>

            <p>
              There is a set of directive classes for each templating engine, but all directives share the same common logic in the form of a strategy class.
              For example, the directive class for the <font class="code">forAllMethods</font> directive to support Freemarker is
              <font class="code">net.sf.jelly.apt.freemarker.transforms.ForAllMethodsTransform</font>.  The class that support the same directive in Jelly is
              <font class="code">net.sf.jelly.apt.tags.ForAllMethodsTag</font>.  But both of these directive classes are nothing more than a thin wrapper
              around a common strategy class, <font class="code">net.sf.jelly.apt.strategies.MethodDeclarationLoopStrategy</font>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whenever you find it necessary to extend an existing APT-Jelly directive take a good look at the existing strategies (and their methods) to see if
              you can meet your requirements with a simple override.  Let's take the above-mentioned example of extending the
              <font class="code">forAllMethods</font> directive to iterate through a set of methods that meet a specific set of requirements.  The
              logic for the <font class="code">forAllMethods</font> directive is defined by the class <font class="code">net.sf.jelly.apt.strategies.MethodDeclarationLoopStrategy</font>.
              Looking at the possible methods we could override, we see that this class extends (among other things)
              <font class="code">net.sf.jelly.apt.strategies.DeclarationLoopStrategy</font> that defines a method, <font class="code">getDeclarations</font>,
              that gets the declarations to loop through.  So, this might be a good place to put our own filtering logic.
            </p>

            <p>
              Consider the following directive strategy class that extends <font class="code">net.sf.jelly.apt.strategies.MethodDeclarationLoopStrategy</font>
              and loops all protected methods that are annotated with the "com.foo.Foo" annotation and that return void.
            </p>

            <center>
              <div class="samplecode">
                <pre>

            <p>
              Now most of the work is done.  We only have to define the class that defines the directive for our templating engine of choice.  The easiest way
              to do that is to extend the existing class for our templating engine and override the necessary methods to reference our strategy that we created
              above.  For example, we could extend <font class="code">net.sf.jelly.apt.freemarker.transforms.ForAllMethodsTransform</font> and override the
              <font class="code">newStrategy</font> method to return instead in instance of <font class="code">ForAllProtectedVoidFooMethodsTag</font>.
            </p>

            <p>
              A few things to note:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The above logic could have also been easily done inline with the template.  You'll have to make your own design decisions to find that delicate balance
                between a heavy, difficult-to-read template and a superfluous custom directive library.
              </li>
              <li>
                The filtering of the method declaration in the above example happens <i>after</i> the declarations are filtered by annotation.  You may decide
                to filter before filtering by annotation name by overriding the <font class="code">getAllDeclarationsToConsiderForAnnotationFiltering</font>
                method.
              </li>
              <li>
                Just in case you don't know, the <font class="code">@java.lang.Override</font> annotation causes a compile failure if any declaration that it
                annotates doesn't override another declaration.  I use this all the time to help me catch API changes at compile-time rather than causing
                a confusing catastrophic runtime error.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The other aspect of APT-Jelly that you may find useful to extend is the decorated mirror API (*).  In this case, the classes you will want to extend
              are the decorators, <font class="code">net.sf.jelly.apt.decorations.DeclarationDecorator</font> and
              <font class="code">net.sf.jelly.apt.decorations.TypeMirrorDecorator</font>.  As you can see, these decorators are implementations of the visitors
              for declarations and types in the Mirror API.  The work done when visiting a given type or declaration is simply to set a local variable to the decorated
              instance of the type or declaration.
            </p>

            <p>
              When extending the decorators, it's only necessary to override the visit method of the type of declaration or type you want to decorate and then
              call the same method of the <font class="code">super</font> with your own decorated instance (*).  Your own decorated instance will need to extend the
              decorated type or declaration class provided by APT-Jelly in order to expose your custom decorated methods.
            </p>

            <p>
              After having defined your decoration and extended the decorator, it's necessary to set a system property so APT-Jelly knows what decorator to use
              when decorating.  This system property is "net.sf.jelly.apt.decorations.DeclarationDecorator" for a declaration decorator and
              "net.sf.jelly.apt.decorations.TypeMirrorDecorator" for type decorator.  The values of these properties should be the fully-qualified class name
              of your custom decorator.
            </p>

            <p>
              As an example, let's extend APT-Jelly by adding another property called "happy" to any class declaration.  (Apologies for such a contrived example.
              All the <i>useful</i> decorations I could think of have already been applied.)  We'll say that a class declaration is "happy" if its simple name
              starts with "Happy".
            </p>

            <p>
              First, we start with extending the decorated class declaration:
            </p>

            <center>
              <div class="samplecode">
                <pre>
package happy;

public class HappilyDecoratedClassDeclaration extends net.sf.jelly.apt.decorations.declaration.DecoratedClassDeclaration {

  public HappilyDecoratedClassDeclaration(com.sun.mirror.declaration.ClassDeclaration delegate) {
    super(delegate);
  }

  public boolean isHappy() {
    return getSimpleName().startsWith("Happy");
  }
}
                </pre>
              </div>
            </center>

            <p>
              Next, we extend <font class="code">net.sf.jelly.apt.decorations.DeclarationDecorator</font> to correctly visit a class declaration:
            </p>

            <center>
              <div class="samplecode">
                <pre>
package happy;

public class HappyDeclarationDecorator extends net.sf.jelly.apt.decorations.DeclarationDecorator {

  public void visitClassDeclaration(com.sun.mirror.declaration.ClassDeclaration declaration) {
    super.visitClassDeclaration(new HappilyDecoratedClassDeclaration(declaration));
  }

}
                </pre>
              </div>
            </center>

            <p>
              As long as we make sure that there is a sytem property named "net.sf.jelly.apt.decorations.DeclarationDecorator" that has the value
              "happy.HappyDeclarationDecorator" when we invoke apt (probably with a -D parameter on the command line), then we should be able to access our decorations
              from the template, e.g.:
            </p>

            <center>
              <div class="samplecode">
                <pre>
&lt;#if classDeclaration.happy&gt;
  &lt;#-- do some happy processing --&gt;
&lt;/#if&gt;
                </pre>
              </div>
            </center>

            <p>
              *NOTE: The strict rigidity of the visitor/decorator pattern causes some irritating inefficiencies when extending the model.  If you decide that
              extending the decorated API is necessary, be aware that when extending the decorations of a type, the <i>subtypes</i> of that type will NOT also
              be decorated.  Using the example above, while we extending a class declaration with the "happy" property, we are NOT extending an enum declaration.
              So, even though an enum declaration extends a class declaration, no enum declarations will be decorated with the "happy" property.  Now just
              think about how irritating it would be if we wanted to decorate *all* declarations with the "happy" property.  We would have to extend every subclass
              of <font class="code">DecoratedDeclaration</font>.  So extend the decorations at your own risk.
            </p>
